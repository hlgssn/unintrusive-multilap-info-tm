# Unintrusive Multilap Info

*Dependent on both MLHook and MLFeed: Race Data* -- you *must* install both of these plugins for Unintrusive Multilap Info to work.

Shows race (multilap) stats in a more "Nadeo" way to not clutter the screen.
Currently capable for showing Best Lap Time as well as Average lap time (both resets on restart). They can be toggled on and off.
Suitable especially for being a part of (or spectating) longer multilap races.
